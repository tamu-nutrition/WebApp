# Installation

console:
```
git clone https://github.com/tamu-nutrition/WebApp.git
cd WebApp
bundle install
yarn install
rails db:create db:migrate
```
# Start the Web Server
```
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```
# Run All Tests
```
rails rspec .

```
# CI/CD Process
Set up CI/CD through GitHub Actions
Go to /.github/workflows/main.yml

## Step 1: set up environment variables
```
env:
  RUBY_VERSION: 3.0.2
  POSTGRES_USER: postgres
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
  DATABASE_USER: postgres
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: password
```
## Step 2: create GitHub action "Rails tests"
Action runs when pushing and creating pull requests
```
name: Rails tests
on: [push, pull_request]
```
## Step 3: Create jobs to run â€“ Rspec test
Since we wanted to test using database as well, we set up postgres 
Then we went into the steps that were used to run Rspec tests using our original version of Ruby. The general steps are listed below. 

1.	Install postgres client
``` 
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```
2.	Install dependencies
```
gem install bundler
bundler install
``` 
3.	Create database
``` 
bundler exec rails db:create RAILS_ENV=test
bundler exec rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```
4.	Run tests
``` 
bundler exec rspec .
```
5.	Run brakeman
```
brakeman -o brakeman.txt
```
6.	Run robocop
``` 
bundler exec rubocop --out rubocop.txt
```
7.	Upload coverage results
8.	Upload rubocop report
9.	Upload brakeman report
